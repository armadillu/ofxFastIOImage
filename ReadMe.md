### ofxFastIOImage

Simple of addon to load / save ofImages byte-to-byte as binary files, instead of traditional png / jpg approach. I found out saving png's using ofImage standard i/o methods is especially slow on an iOS. This add-on might speed up save/load for platforms with slow cpu and fast i/o. Of course the downside is that the files are not readable by anything elseâ€¦ 

Requires ofxXmlSettings, and the example uses ofxTimeMeasurements to measure times. 

On an iPhone 4s, ofxFastIOImage is 2x faster at loading and 5x faster at saving than the usual ofImage methods.
